# MUSIC FADERNETS: CONTROLLABLE MUSIC GENERATION BASED ON HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES VIA LOW-LEVEL FEATURE MODELLING

## Brief overall summary
### Aim
The aim of the research in this paper was to create a model capable of controlling generated music output subject to user-controlled, high-level presets (in particular, arousal). This also includes the abilty to control low-level features of the generated music via sliders.

### Implementation/Method used
The high-level feature that they focus on is arousal. They use musicology research to justify choosing low-level features rhythm, note and key, as these contribute to a musical piece's arousal.
