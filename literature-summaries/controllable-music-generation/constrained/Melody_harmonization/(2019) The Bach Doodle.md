# The Bach Doodle: Approachable Music Composition with Machine Learning at Scale

## Brief overall summary
### Aim
Create an AI-powered Google Doodle, using Coconet [[(2019) Counterpoint by Convolution]] to harmonize a user given melody, in the style of Bach. This paper mostly focuses on developing the Google Doodle, rather than an generative music algorithm development.

### Implementation/Method used
This used Coconet [[(2019) Counterpoint by Convolution]] as the model for generating the harmonization.

### Achievements
- Reimplementing Coconet in TensorFlow.js and reducing runtime from 40s to 2s, in order to be suitable for a browser app.

### Limitations
- Only in the style of Bach. A very specific subset of haronization with specific rules.
